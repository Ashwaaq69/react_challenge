// Exercises: What is React?
// What is React?

// React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications (SPAs). It allows developers to create reusable components and manage the application's state efficiently.
// What is a library?

// A library is a collection of prewritten code that developers can use to perform common tasks or solve specific problems, enabling faster development.
// What is a single-page application?

// A single-page application (SPA) is a web application that dynamically updates the content on a single web page without requiring a full page reload, providing a smoother user experience.
// What is a component?

// A component is a reusable and independent piece of the user interface in React. Components can be functional or class-based and manage their state and behavior.
// What is the latest version of React?

// As of now, the latest version of React is React 18 (released in March 2022). Please check for updates if necessary.
// What is DOM?

// DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage and allows scripts to update content, structure, and style.
// What is React Virtual DOM?

// The React Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React updates the Virtual DOM first, calculates the differences (diffing), and then updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM, improving performance.
// What does a web application or a website (composed of) have?

// A web application or website typically consists of:
// HTML for structure.
// CSS for styling.
// JavaScript for interactivity.
// Back-end services (e.g., APIs or databases) for data.
// Exercises: Why React?
// Why did you choose to use React?

// React offers:
// Reusability of components.
// A large ecosystem of tools and libraries.
// Efficient performance via the Virtual DOM.
// Strong community support and popularity.
// What measures do you use to know popularity?

// Popularity can be measured using:
// GitHub stars and forks.
// The number of downloads on npm.
// Community engagement (e.g., Stack Overflow questions, conferences).
// Job postings and demand in the industry.
// What is more popular, React or Vue?

// React is generally more popular than Vue, as indicated by its adoption by large companies, higher npm downloads, GitHub stars, and wider community support.
// Exercises: JSX
// What is an HTML element?

// An HTML element is a basic building block of a webpage, defined by tags (e.g., <div>, <p>). It represents content and structure.
// How to write a self-closing HTML element?

// Self-closing elements do not require a closing tag. Example: <img src="image.jpg" />, <input type="text" />.
// What is an HTML attribute? Write some of them.

// HTML attributes provide additional information about elements. Examples:
// id, class, src, href, alt, type, style.
// What is JSX?

// JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files. It makes it easier to create React components.
// What is Babel?

// Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript code (ES6+ or JSX) into a version compatible with older browsers.
// What is a transpiler?

// A transpiler converts code from one language or syntax to another. For example, Babel transpiles JSX and modern JavaScript into plain JavaScript.
